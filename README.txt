How to run the models:

- you should be able to run the models by just running the notebooks,
- then setting up the right paths for all the files
- eg: %cd /content/drive/MyDrive/...
     should be changed to whatever directory you are in and files should be ran in
     appropriate folder
     
- for each of the models, follow their github page for more instructions:
